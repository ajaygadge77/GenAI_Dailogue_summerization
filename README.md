# GenAI_Dailogue_summerization

A cutting-edge project for dialogue summarization using Generative AI. This repository provides tools, models, and scripts to automatically summarize conversations, meetings, and dialogues, making it easier to extract key information and insights from large volumes of text.

## 🚀 Features

- **State-of-the-Art Summarization Models:** Leverages advanced transformer-based architectures for high-quality summaries.
- **Multi-Lingual Support:** Summarize dialogues in multiple languages (customizable).
- **Easy Integration:** Modular codebase with simple APIs for quick integration.
- **Customizable Pipelines:** Adjust preprocessing, summarization, and post-processing steps as per your requirements.
- **Interactive Demos:** Jupyter notebooks and demo scripts to showcase functionality.
- **Extensible Framework:** Easily plug in new models or datasets.

## 🖼️ Example

> **Input Dialogue:**  
> Alice: Hi Bob, did you finish the report?  
> Bob: Yes, I sent it to your email this morning.  
> Alice: Great, I’ll review and get back to you.  

> **Generated Summary:**  
> Bob finished and sent the report to Alice, who will review it.
